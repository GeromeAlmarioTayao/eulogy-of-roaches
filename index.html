<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li> There are around 4,600 species of cockroaches. But fortunately, only 30 species share the human habitat. Out of 30 only four of them are quite
 <br>famous as pests.
<li> Cockroaches are highly adaptive and that is the reason why they have been living on this earth way older than us, in fact older than dinosaurs
 <br>too! If new studies were to be believed, then they evolved 359 million years ago, in Carboniferous period.
<li> Are you scared of cockroaches which are of roughly 1 to 2 inches? Then you better don�t see other species of cockroach because they can be as
 <br>big as 3 inches. The largest cockroach is Megaloblatta longipennis which measures �just� 3.8 inches with 8-inch wingspan. It is found in 
 <br>Central and South America.
<li> Another reason why they are so adaptable � they can survive on anything. They can eat debris, fruits, meat, other insects, our food, the list
 <br>just goes on� they can eat anything just to make sure they live.
<li> They are cold blooded animals. This means that they can maintain a low rate of metabolism and hence, can survive without food even for a 
 <br>month. But they can�t stay thirsty. Most cockroaches die of thirst and in general cockroaches can stay without water for a maximum period of 
 <br>about 2 weeks.
<li> Guess what? They can live for around a week without their heads. But they can hold their breath for about 40 minutes and they can remain in 
 <br>water for a nice 30 minutes.
<li> How do the cockroaches survive without head? After the head of a cockroach is cut off, clotting will seal off the neck and prevent blood loss.
 <br>The brain of a cockroach is not responsible for breathing and neither is the blood responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body.
<li> Cockroaches are thigmotropic i.e., they like to be touched on all sides! They like to be in contact with something solid from all sides of the
 <br>body. Now did you understand why cockroaches are in love with those crevices of your home?
<li> It is a myth that cockroaches survive nuclear explosion. But they can bear more radiation than us. While an average human can tolerate 800 rems
 <br>(unit of radiation dose), the cockroaches can tolerate up to 10,500 rems.
<li> They are always blamed for spreading diseases and doing harm to humans but they do good work for earth. They help in decomposing the debris 
 <br>thereby help bringing the much-needed nutrients back to the soil. They also serve as food for other small animals like lizards, birds and in 
 <br>this way, keep the food chain in good shape.
<li> Cockroaches helped our ancestors. How, you ask? The tiny creatures used to feed on the bat�s dung from cave�s walls and ceilings and made the 
 <br>caves neat where humans could dwell.
<li>  Scientists are now trying (even succeeded a little) to turn cockroaches into cyborgs. They are gluing receiver on to the cockroach�s back and
 <br>inserting electrodes in the insects receptors to control their movement.

<li> Lumbera was born in Lipa on April 11, 1932. He was barely a year old when his father, Christian Lumbera, fell from a fruit tree, broke his back, and died.
 <br>Carmen Lumbera, his mother, suffered from cancer and died a few years later. By the age of five he was an orphan. He and his older sister were cared for 
 <br>by theirpaternal grandmother, Eusebia Teru.
<li> Lumbera received his Litt.B. and M.A. degrees from the University of Santo Tomas in 1950, and then his Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Indiana

<br>numerous books on literary history, literary criticism, and film. He also received several awards citing his contribution to Philippine letters, most notably
<br>the 1975 Palanca Award for Literature; the 1993 Magsaysay Award for Journalism, Literature, and Creative Communication Arts; several National Book Awards 
<br>from the Manila Critics Circle; the 1998 Philippine Centennial Literary Prize for Drama; and the 1999 Cultural Center of the Philippines Centennial Honors
